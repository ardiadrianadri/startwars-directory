        You don't know me! Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty,
        just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around. Yea and I made the stars that
        became the carbon in your mothers ovaries! No! Look away! I'm making an
        egg, Mom! Ughâ€¦! I'm making an egg!

        What, you think I'd waste our home teaching you a fucking lesson? I am 
        gonna miss this place, though: Johnny Carson's still alive and on the air, 
        9/11 never happened, and Rocky Road ice cream has peanut butter and jelly 
        instead of marshmallows. Don't be trippin dog we got you. I couldn't hear 
        you over my own screaming. We've talked about this! Haha god-damn!
